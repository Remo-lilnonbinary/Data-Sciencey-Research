# data-sciencey-research

A collection of university data science and applied research projects.  
The work in this repository is intentionally varied and exploratory rather than polished or production-ready.

Most projects use **R** to work through different problem statements, with a focus on:
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Regression and statistical modelling
- Data visualisation and interpretation
- Translating quantitative results into clear insights

The projects reflect coursework across statistics, social research, and applied data analysis, which is why the topics and approaches can feel quite random.

## What you’ll find in this repo

- R scripts and RMarkdown notebooks  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Regression analyses (e.g. linear, logistic, model comparison)  
- Visualisation using `ggplot2`  
- Coursework-style projects with an emphasis on reasoning and interpretation

## What this repo is (and isn’t)

### This repo *is*:
- A record of learning and experimentation  
- Coursework-driven analysis  
- Problem-first, method-second exploration  

### This repo is *not*:
- A single cohesive project  
- Production-grade or optimised code  
- A domain-specific portfolio

## Tools & methods

- **R**
- `tidyverse`
- `ggplot2`
- `broom`
- Regression-based modelling
- Visual and statistical diagnostics
- Reproducible analysis via RMarkdown

## Notes

Projects are added over time and vary in structure and depth depending on the original assignment brief.  
Some are cleaner than others, that’s part of the learning process.
